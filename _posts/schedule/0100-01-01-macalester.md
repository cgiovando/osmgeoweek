The event location will be on Macalester's Campus in Carnegie 108 (the GIS lab). All Macalester students, faculty and staff are welcome. No GIS experience required. Attached is our promotional poster. I'm wondering if it would be possible to add a paragraph or two about what humanitarian mapping is. You could take it right from our poster, or if you guys have some you like to use or link to. We've included this link in our online campus newsletter, so a fairly broad audience might be looking at it, I would like it to address what the event is about, and why people should participate, if possible.
