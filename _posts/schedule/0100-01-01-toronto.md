Learning QGIS and OpenStreetMap - Three short talks and plenty of Q&A

We love open street map, and for GIS Day 2014 we'd like to share our passion and knowledge with you. If you use Google Maps or Google Earth to gather information about what's happening on the ground, we guarantee you'll be interested in OSM. We'll introduce you to the project and show you how to get the data into QGIS, a free, open source mapping program
