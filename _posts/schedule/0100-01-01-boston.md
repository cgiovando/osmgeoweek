Join us for a Mapathon as OSM-Boston participates in the OpenStreetMap Geography Awareness Week! Beginners welcome!

Like at previous Mapathons/Editathons, mappers all over the US get together to improve OpenStreetMap - the world's biggest crowd-sourced map. In this mapathon event, our focus will specifically be on improving the tagging of Massachusetts schools using MapRoulette. Or your favorite mapping project.
