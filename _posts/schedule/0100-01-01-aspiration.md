At the <a href="https://aspirationtech.org/events/devsummit14">2014 Nonprofit Software Development Summit</a>, Schuyler Erle will lead an HOT mapping workshop "Mapping for Crisis & Development" next Wednesday. He'll present OSM generally and HOT in particular and show people how to use iD to get started mapping right away. We'll work on Ebola-related mapping in West Africa.
