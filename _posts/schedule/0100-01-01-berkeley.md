GIS Day is this Wednesday at UC Berkeley's Mulford Hall. There is going to be an intro to OSM editing from about 5:15-5:45 and then we're going to pick a task on tasks.hotosm.org and work on that together. If you've never edited before and want to learn how or just want to meet some fellow mappers and map together this is your chance. There will also be a number of other GIS talks and presentations going on. Agenda at the bottom of <a href="http://gif.berkeley.edu/gisday.html">this page</a>. 

See you there!
