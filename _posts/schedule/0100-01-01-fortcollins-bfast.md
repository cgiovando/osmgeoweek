Join us at the Old Town Library's community room #1 (http://www.poudrelibraries.org/) to map our local food chain (CSAs, producers, and groceries and restaurants specializing in local products). Bonus: because we're history minded in the Fort and this town was founded on sugar beets, we're also mapping sites connected with the history of the local sugar beet industry. Wifi is provided by the library. Bring your laptop and we'll get you started with OpenStreetMap.
