Please join us Thursday, 20 November, between 2 and 4:30pm in community room #1 at the [Main Poudre River Public Library](http://www.poudrelibraries.org/) for a Geography Awareness Week mapping event. As a part of the [Future of Food Mapathon](http://osmgeoweek.org/plan/intro/) we're mapping local food resources and annotating our work so that it can be combined with that of other food mappers world wide. No experience with OpenStreetMap is necessary and no materials other than your own laptop and a modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) are required. Wifi is provided by the library and experienced OSM mappers will be present to help you get started.

Check out [#osmgeoweek](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=osmgeoweek) on Twitter so see what's going on elsewhere and email [Sean Gillies](mailto:sean.gillies@gmail.com) for questions about this event in Fort Collins.
