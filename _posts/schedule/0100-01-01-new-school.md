Let's map community gardens together! There are hundreds of community gardens in New York City. Some are in OpenStreetMap, and some aren't. The tagging isn't very consistent when the gardens are there. We'll fix this situation and talk about getting the data back out to use as you please. Other food-related mapping is welcome, too! Meet us in "The Bark Room" at The New School, on the ground floor of 2 West 13th Street.
