There will be a humanitarian mapping and learning get together at Maker-Works Ann Arbor in honor of the #OSMGeoWeek, #MissingMaps and #hotosm community mapping events. We will learn about what OpenStreetMap is, what the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team does and how volunteer mapping gets used on the ground in the areas we map. Then we will map a few items and add them to OpenStreetMap. Participants can work on any task from the OSMGeoWeek event, the ongoing MSF Missing Maps effort, or any of the other mapping projects on the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's Tasking Manager web site. Or they can work on any local mapping that might interest them.

If you can not attend in person but would like to attend a ""Virtual Mapping Party"" during this event, please get in touch with the contact person (bgirardot@gmail.com) to talk over your remote options.
