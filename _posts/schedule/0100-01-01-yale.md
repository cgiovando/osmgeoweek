MapGive Mapathon

Join Stace Maples for an Open Lab exploration of the tools and resources available for contributing to humanitarian relief efforts through mapping. We'll have an introduction to Openstreetmap.org and the Humanitarian OSM Team's Task Manager at 2pm and open lab for contributing to various relief and development mapping projects for the remainder of the session. Can't make it at 2pm? No worries. Come by when you can and we'll get you mapping for good in no time.
