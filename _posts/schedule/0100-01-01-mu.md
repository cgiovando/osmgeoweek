Join us Tuesday, November 18 from 4 until 7 p.m. at the Benton-Bingham room in the second floor of the Memorial Union. We will begin with a quick background on MapGive's collaborative effort with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to support responders in Sierra Leone and Liberia who are fighting the spread of Ebola virus. We will also be presenting a short brief on OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping for beginners, so new volunteer mappers are welcome. If you can't make it right at 4, that's no problem. Come join for as long as you can - we will be available for help the whole time.
