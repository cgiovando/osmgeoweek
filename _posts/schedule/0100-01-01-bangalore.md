Teachers, students, community groups, map lovers, around the world, join together to celebrate geography and make maps with OpenStreetMap, the free and openly editable map of the world.

Right after talking about OpenStreetMap in Action, we will get together and map! This is the ideal event to learn how you can create your own maps with OpenStreetMap or if you already know, a great opportunity to connect with like-minded folks.
