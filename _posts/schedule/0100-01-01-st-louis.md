Main event at Delmar Loop see website a <href="http://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-STL/events/214247942/">Meetup</a>
The Delmar Loop has been named one of the 10 Great Streets in America - and is home to retail, 
restaurants, live music venues, art galleries, and the St. Louis Walk of Fame - but you 
wouldn't know it from looking at the map of the Delmar Loop in OpenStreetMap. Come help us fix that!
