## Using Shortcuts:

Note: You can access more editing options/shortcuts by holding the shift key and clicking more than one feature. For instance, to merge two lines, hold shift, select the two lines to be merged and then click the + sign. 

###	To pan across ID Editor:

* +&nbsp;(on numpad) – zoom in
* -&nbsp;(on numpad) – zoom out
* ↓, ↑, ←, → (cursor keys) – pan map

### To add/edit features:

* 1 – switch to "add point" mode
* 2 – switch to "add line" (aka “way”) mode
* 3 – switch to "add area" mode
* A – continue drawing a line at the selected node
* B – display background layer switcher
* C – combine two lines (need to be connected by a shared node and be both selected before)
* D – if shared node of multiple lines is selected: unjoins the associated lines (that duplicate the shared node)
* H – show in-editor help/documentation

### Editor Wheel shortcuts (accessing the editor wheel is done by simply clicking on any feature):

* M – move object (if object is selected)
* O – arrange nodes as circle (only closed lines, that is: areas)
* R – rotate object
* S – straighten the selected line, or square the corners of the selected area or closed line
* Ctrl+S – save

### Editing multiple features at the same time (ex. Splitting and joining lines):

<img src="/img/post-images/id-multiple.jpg" />

* ⇧ Shift + mouse click – selection of multiple objects
* V – reverse line direction (if line selected)
* X – split line (if node in line selected)
* Ctrl+Z – undo last action
* Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y (on Windows) – redo last undid action
* Ctrl+Del / Ctrl+← Backspace – delete currently selected object
* ↵ Enter / Esc – stop drawing of a line or area
* F11 (Linux, Windows) / Ctrl+⌘ Cmd+F (Mac) – set your browser to full screen mode for more space (generic browser shortcut and varies by browser)
