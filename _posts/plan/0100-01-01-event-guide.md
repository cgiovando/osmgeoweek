## Recruitment

Clearly students were our primary audience, but we also promoted the event to professionals/citizens who were likely to have GIS/OSM skills.  We also promoted the event to international students in general, a group whom I thought would be interested in international humanitarian efforts.  Altogether we had 45 participant, exactly the number we were shooting for and the capacity of our primary venue.  We did have some overflow areas prepared just in case, but did not have to use them.  In terms of turnout, we had about 70% students and 30% non-student OSM enthusiasts from the area, some of whom came from 40 to 90 miles away to spend the day mapping.  Of the students about 30% were international students, half of whom were not students in the geography program and two of whom were from a local Native American college. So here’s the breakdown of our pre-event recruitment strategy:
 
### Emails

* Sent emails to Geography department listserv
* Coordinated with our office of International Student Services to have emails sent to all international students at KU
* Posted notice on our regional OSM Meetup Group calendar of events
* Posted notice on our regional GIS Meetup Group calendar of events
* Had the state geospatial clearinghouse manager send out information to GIS professionals in the area
* Sent out targeted invitations to individuals not covered by the above
 
### Personal appearances

* Arranged to give short pitch at the beginning of class in several geography classes with geospatial technology focus
* Talked personally with key faculty / students to encourage them to attend
 
### Flyers

* Posted flyers at key locations across campus
* Put flyers in geography faculty/graduate student mail boxes
 
We also posted the event on the university event calendar.
 
Nearly all of the strategies above produced results by either connecting to unique groups or reinforcing the message to the point that people committed to participating.  Always put your marketing hat on and imagine that you are selling a product, which you am.  As a matter of fact, for each email, flyer, calendar posting I customized it to what would be of interest to that group.  For instance, to the international students I emphasized that they would get skills that would allow them to assist when humanitarian disasters strike their own countries, to the OSM enthusiasts I promoted it as a humanitarian OSM event, etc.  Also, the State Department has done a nice job with the Why Map video and I used this in my presentations as a starting point.
 
## Registration
 
For this type of event I find that it is helpful to “require” registration.  Although there was no fee for participation, having participants register beforehand allows me to have a very good sense of how many people will show up, plus I can provide additional event details on the registration page.  Plus, this provides a way to track who attended and acts as a failsafe in case something comes up that requires a change in venue, rescheduling, or cancellation.
 
We used Eventbrite.  This is free, if the event is free, and it has some nice features that allow management of the tickets/event.  Some other events like this charge a nominal fee to encourage people to actually show up if the register.  I have participated in events that refunded the registration fee if you actually show up to the event.
 
Certainly we did not turn anybody away for the event, and did have a few people show up who did not register.  Again, registration is mainly a tool to help with logistics.
 
## Venue Logistics
 
### Food

We were able to secure $200US to provide free food and beverages for the event.  This allowed us to buy plenty of soda/water, various snacks, and pizza to keep people happily mapping all day.  This in an important thing to offer, if you can, because this is both a draw to get people to participate, and hunger/thirst are not a reason to leave.
 
### Power

For our event we asked people to bring their own laptops.  This has both the benefit of not having to secure a computer lab for the day (which generally do not allow food/drink in the lab room), and I believe that there is a subtle message that says “you can do this on your own computer, anytime, anywhere.”  I tried to reinforce this to participant during the event.
 
### Computers

As mentioned, we had participants bring their own laptops.  There are a couple of logistical consideration if you decide to do this.  First, be sure to remind people to bring an external mouse (usb/wireless) because digitizing with a touchpad is very frustrating.  Second, it is important to have power available to for each laptop.  For our event I rounded-up/borrowed a bunch of extension cords and power strips and went in before the event to map out the power supply strategy and identify where all of the outlets were and how many extension cords and power strips were needed, and how they would be laid out on the tables.  In addition, some students did not have laptops that they could bring, so I arranged to have extra laptops there.
 
### Space

With 42 or so laptops whizzing away, the room got a little warmer than usual, keep this in mind.  I tried to set up the room to have a as much space as possible while maximizing the number of seats for our participants.
 
### Internet

This may be obvious, but a reliable internet connection is a requirement. 
 
## Coordination with State Department:
 
Because MapGive had just rolled out, I worked closely with Josh Campbell at State to be sure that they knew when we were holding the event and which task we would be working on.  This also was helpful for leveraging social media to promote the event and tweet out pics and progress throughout the day.
 
I thought that it would be valuable for participants to get some live feedback from the State Department, so Josh Skyped in during the event to give an overview of the MapGive effort and to emphasize the value of the work the people were doing.  This was a nice touch that allowed people to feel connected in a very real way to a larger effort (thanks Josh).  We were able to put this on the projection screen so that everyone could see it (obviously this requires a webcam on at least one end, if not two).
 
## Other details related mappy activates for the Punia task:
 
### Context

I tried to emphasize the fact that we were not just putting lines on a map, but were doing something that was helping real people in an area that has real humanitarian need.  To that end I included information in emails/flyers/personal communication that talked about the situation in the DRC, and also printed a large, poster sized page from the USAID Fact Sheet on the ongoing complex humanitarian crisis in the DRC, and displayed it prominently at the event.
 
### Ambiance

In order to create a little ambiance during the event, we played some music from the Congo region.  This was designed to both create a connection to the culture of the region that we were mapping, and to give a little energy to the room.
 
As an added bonus, Jesse Smith from the Kansas Division of Emergency Management brought his Public Information Geographic Information (PIGI) vehicle,http://kansastag.gov/NGUARD.asp?PageID=485 , which is a mobile GIS mapping center that is deployed during disaster events, so that was great for the participants to see as well. There was even space inside for about 5 people to do their mapping inside the PIGI.  There were a number of benefits to coordinating this added feature, so I recommend keeping an open mind to other related things that can be incorporated into your event.
 
In addition to the KU event, I helped coordinate activities at two other universities through a network of colleagues in other states of the AmericaView network (New Hampshire and Pennsylvania).  For this I created a “how-to” packet that that was sent out to all of the other AmericaView states and kept them updated on any relevant information encountered during the planning.  Their implementations were different as they used this as an exercise in GIS and remote sensing courses that were being taught, essentially as a lab exercise.  The short lead time that we had this time around only allowed for limited participation, but next time I think that we will have a much better chance of including more universities in a coordinated activity.  Plans for this are already in the works.
 
On the projection screen we also put up the live OSM edit feed at http://live.openstreetmap.fr/ . This gave a nice feel that the participants were doing something that was part of something bigger, and something that others around the world were also working on at the same time.
 
## Lessons learned
 
### Caveats
 
DON’T USE INTERNET EXPLORER (Chrome and Firefox work fine, IE does not at all).
 
Save edits often. We had and issue of unknown origin that caused the iD Editor to throw an error when more than one person was editing the same feature (in this case is was a main road that ran across the entire task area.  It was one of the only features that was already in OSM, and it needed geometric corrections in every tile it was in.  The only fix was to “undo” edits back to the point where the road was first edited since the last save (you could not undo just edit that).  Apparently this is not what usually happens under normal circumstances, but may have to the do with the “relates” in the database for that feature.  Fortunately we had an OSM guru on hand who helped find the fix online.

### For next time

We will start with an OSM beginners workshop at the front end of the event (for an hour or so), then have experienced OSMers join in, or perhaps assign an experienced OSMer to a small group of people during the first hour to work with them closely.  I’m still working on how we’ll do this. If your event is primarily for beginner, then this may not be an issue.  Perhaps we can talk about this component on the phone?
 
We tried to get University Relations to cover the event, but given the short timeline this did not work out as hoped.  There is a lot of value to be gained by getting the word out about the event, even after the fact, because this give other the encouragement they need to have one too, and the can point to the online coverage to get support – thus giving your even a multiplier effect down the line.
 
I think that we need a better follow up strategy for participants.  Several international participants indicated a strong interest in hosting a similar event or starting a group in their home countries upon their return home countries.  I would like to be able to transition into working with them soon after the event so that we can provide support, and additional training for them while the “iron is hot.”  We had students from India, Brazil, Egypt, and Libya who all expressed this same sentiment, the desire to begin enhance the quality and completeness of OSM in their home countries.  This is something that I hope to work on this summer while at the HIU, among other things.
 
Our goal is to work with the university to incorporate this as part of the university service learning certificate program, which has a requirement to volunteering (20 hours).  This would be a great way to bring in people who might not have been attracted to it otherwise, and to give them an opportunity to be involved in the planning of the event as well.
 
### Follow on activities
 
Gave a presentation to our state GIS policy board on the KU Mapathon event, in early May. 
 
Scheduled to give a similar talk, but more about MapGive and humanitarian mapping to a local chapter of the Rotatory Club International in late September.
 
### Next planned events
 
Jesse and I are working with a local chapter of an international humanitarian organization called ShelterBox to incorporate a mapathon into an event that they are hosting in October. 
 
We plan to replicate the event described above in November as part of the GIS-Day/Geography Awareness week here at KU and in cooperation with other universities in our area.
 
Next spring we will have another mapathon as our AmericaView Earth Observation Day event.  We should be able to get much wider participation from other states in the network (currently there are 39).
 
 
Well, I think that this a decent summary.  I’m sure I left out a few things, so if I think of anything I’ll send and addendum.  I know that there are some things specific to the mapping itself that I did not include as this might be best discussed over the phone.  Please let me know what questions you have and I look forward to hearing more about your event.
