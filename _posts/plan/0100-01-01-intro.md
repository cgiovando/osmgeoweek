This year’s theme is, “The Future of Food” and these pages are a guide to adding food-related resources to OpenStreetMap and cover several topics.

1. What we’re mapping – Some general notes about today’s event…
2. How to make the most of the iD editor. 
3. How to tag, or add attributes to those features 
4. Saving your work using the #osmgeoweek hashtag

#What We’re Mapping

We’re focusing our efforts today on mapping local food resources, including community-supported agriculture, urban farms, and community gardens. Broadly speaking, any food resource:

* Grocery stores, bodegas, restaurants, fast food outlets
* Farmers markets, community gardens, 
* Croplands, orchards, ranches, plantations, farm fields
* Grain elevators, flour mills, irrigation systems, canneries, food warehouses

…basically, anything that has a role in food production, distribution, or consumption

#Some important ground rules and tips:

1. Have fun! We’re here to develop a shared understanding of the geography of food and agricultural processes. Make friends!
2. Ask for help, discuss how to map with your colleagues – how should you represent what’s on the ground? Point? Line? Area? Strive for consensus and consult available resources. 
3. ***Never, ever copy from Google*** (or any other proprietary data source). You may use Google (or Yahoo or Bing) to find a source web page, but Google’s terms & conditions expressly forbid copying. Get your information from a ***primary source*** – fieldwork or the target web site. We list some sources for you below.
4. See Rule #3.
