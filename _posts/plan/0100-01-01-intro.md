Here's an overview of the mapathon and guides.

# Are you new to OpenStreetMap?

If you are new to OpenStreetMap, you'll want to sign up for an account and watch the tutorials on getting started with editing and the tasking manager. Head over to <a href="http://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/">MapGive and learn to map</a>, then come back here to learn more about the tasks for OSMGeoWeek.

# OSMGeoWeek Guides

This year’s theme is, “The Future of Food” and these pages are a guide to adding food-related resources to OpenStreetMap and cover several topics.

1. What we’re mapping – Some general notes below about today’s event…
2. <a href="/plan/id-editor/">How to make the most of the iD editor</a>. 
3. How to <a href="/plan/tags/">tag</a>, or add attributes to those features 
4. <a href="/plan/editing/">Saving your work</a> using the <a href="http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-changesets?comment=osmgeoweek#2/33.9/1.4">#osmgeoweek</a> hashtag

#What We’re Mapping

Check out the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> to see what we're working on.

For the remote tasks, check out the instructions in the tasking manager for each. For newcomers, <a href="/project/nyamira/">Nyamira, Kenya</a> is a good place to start.

For local tasks, we’re focusing our efforts today on mapping food resources, including community-supported agriculture, urban farms, and community gardens. Broadly speaking, any food resource:

* Grocery stores, bodegas, restaurants, fast food outlets
* Farmers markets, community gardens, 
* Croplands, orchards, ranches, plantations, farm fields
* Grain elevators, flour mills, irrigation systems, canneries, food warehouses

…basically, anything that has a role in food production, distribution, or consumption

#Some important ground rules and tips:

1. Have fun! We’re here to develop a shared understanding of the geography of food and agricultural processes. Make friends!
2. Ask for help, discuss how to map with your colleagues – how should you represent what’s on the ground? Point? Line? Area? Strive for consensus and consult available resources. 
3. ***Never, ever copy from Google*** (or any other proprietary data source). You may use Google (or Yahoo or Bing) to find a source web page, but Google’s terms & conditions expressly forbid copying. Get your information from a ***primary source*** – fieldwork or the target web site. We list some sources for you below.
4. See Rule #3. 
5. DON’T USE INTERNET EXPLORER (Chrome and Firefox work fine, IE does not at all).
