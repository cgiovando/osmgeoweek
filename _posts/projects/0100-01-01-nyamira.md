Nyamira County is an agricultural district, just starting up its GIS office.

In one part, from satellite imagery, we'll map as much of the infrastructure, land use, buildings, etc, as detectable from remote sensing, into OpenStreetMap. This could be a remote activity for folks around the globe, increasing the visibility of Nyamira County greatly. The second part, will be a surveying event in Nyamira County, to fill in details.
