We plan to map local farmer’s markets to include where the vendors are coming from.  We would like to discuss details of the topic with GMU and OSM organizers.  One outcome will be OSM Tasking Manager assignments.
 
We found these two resources online. Participants could look up the information using the sources below and then add information to OSM.
