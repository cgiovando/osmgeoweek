Research and map food security-related organizations and assets locally. Compile lists of food banks, community gardens, CSA drop-off locations, food stores that accept WICS or food stamps, and similar locations. Process and geocode their addresses, and add to OSM using Food Security tags. Reach out to local food organizations, and build on their ideas to visualize and share the collected data.

## Data Preparation

In the run-up to the event, a few organizers should compile and process these asset lists, along with their addresses and any other important information, remove duplicates, and break them into manageable chunks for teams of 2 or 3 to spend a few hours working on entering into OpenStreetMap.  The teams will use the address info, along with some detective skills, to enter the data. lat/lon info can be obtained from an address through a geocoding service like <a href="http://geocoder.us/">http://geocoder.us/</a> ahead of time, or make this option available to the teams. For tagging guidelines, we'll use <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Food_security">Food Security Tags</a>

## Outreach

Reach out local food organizations to let them know about OSMGeoWeek and see if they have any interest in participating. Get their ideas on how to visualize the data, specific maps that they would find useful to their work, or suggestions on what else to map.
